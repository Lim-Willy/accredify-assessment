Current status of project
1) Able to login to go to the dashboard
2) has another page to go into the file verification page
3) able to drag and drop and also select file for uploading
4) only a single file can be uploaded at a time

refactoring consideration
1) i would like to change the way DTO Trait works on retrieving and filling DTO with just an array
2) i would also try to create a helper for handling HTTP class functions to have a more standardized request.

Issues to look into
1) UNauthorized when submitting verification on FrontEnd when using php serve commands
